                        and globally competitive sector. The focus is on meeting market demands, 
                        fostering a knowledge-based economy, and leading in information systems for 
                        digital sovereignty and security.

                        like The University of Queensland, The University of Adelaide, 
                        and the University of Technology Sydney.
